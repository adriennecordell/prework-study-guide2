# Prework Study Guide Webpage 

## Description


- My motivation for starting this project was to start learing how to code and have a good base of knowledge before the bootcamp class started. 
- I built this project to have a space to access all the knowledge I learned while completing the boot camp prework.
- The Prework Study guide webpage shows my professors that I completed the prework and created a webpage that I can edit and others can view.
- While completing this webpage I learned how to use terminal on my mac, how to use HTML to frame a webpage, how to use CSS to style a webpage, and how to use JavaScript to make a webpage interactive. I also learned how to problem solve and persevere through problems. I learned how to use commands in the terminal to link the changes to my GitHub repository.

## Usage

-This webpage can be used as a great tool to find information that fellow bootcamp students and myself have learned during the prework required for this course. More specifically you can open the webpage and find notes on all the sections that were covered in prework. This webpage has four sections. One section for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This webpage also has a console feature to test code, see the JavaScript running, and randomly generate a topic to study.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.

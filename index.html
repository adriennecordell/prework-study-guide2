      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML is made up of elements which work together to provide content and basic framework for all pages on the web.</li>
        <li>The head element contains information or metadata that helps the browser render the page correctly.</li>
        <li>The body element contains content that is shown to the user. </li>
        <li>All elements we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside the body element.</li>
        <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.
        <li>Lang="en" tells the browser the language for the webpage.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS; Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and External CSS.</li>
         <li>An example of inline CSS is using the 'style' attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading.</li>
         <li>An example of Internal CSS is using the style attribute to change the color of all the h1 headings.</li>
         <li>External CSS, also the most common way to style a webpage, is used by linking a file in the 'link' element placed in the HTML's 'head'</li>
         <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
         <li>A padding indicates how much space we want sound the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="card" id="git-section"> 
      <h2>Git</h2>
       <ul>
          <li>Git command must precede every Git statement.</li>
          <li>The Git status command tells us which branch we are currently working in.</li>
          <li>The Git checkout command switches branches.</li>
          <li>Git add -A command adds modifications in current working branch to the staging area and the -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
          <li>Git commit -m "add starter code" is a commit. The words in quotations describe what the commit contains.</li>
          <li>Commits must be in quotations!</li>

         <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
         <li>An array is a single varible that is used to hold a group of data. Usually this data is related in some way. </li>
         <li>A for loop contains three inportant statements. The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. The second statement determines the condition of the loop. The third statement is what allows the array to iterate over each time.</li>
         <li>To create a function we use the 'function' keyword. A functions name is followed by parenthesis.</li>
